# Encryption and Decryption - SOC

SOC - Summer of Code is a programme of Web and Coding Club (WnCC) of IIT Bombay where students can choose from a pool of 50+ projects, study about them under the guidance of a mentor, solve assignments and make report to ensure that they have understood the course and gained knowledge about the topic.

## Encryption and Decryption

Say I need to send a message, devoid of any unwanted views, to my friend. The primary goal would be to put a seal to the message, it might be in the form of using sealed 
envelopes, or using a box with locks, etc.  This is the encrytion of the message and the various moves to take to prevent it from leaking are the modes of encryption. 
the better encryption, the lesser are the chances of it being vulnerable to unwanted attention. (NTA's gotta learn this 😆). Ok now other easier way would be to just 
change every chracter to a different character/symbol and just me and my friend would be aware of it. The set of list of all the mappings of the letters to a symbol is a code.
Only you and your friend must know the code.

Ok then why decryption, Well it has always been considered in a negative sense, but infact if implementd by trustworthy hands can help in cracking up many unsolved cases and even help 
in prevention of any misuse of power, now not going much in the depths of the usefullness of this this, since you all are aware of this. Lets move on to how to do this.

So you would have understood the intent of this project to - predict the code so that we can decrypt the message. In general we can still decrypt using hits and trials / algorithm
to find out the code, but it becomes harder and complicated if the message length increases or the code in itself is complicated. Now, here comes the AI. We can train the mode
to understand the relationship between the input and output and make it easier to decrypt to sme extent the stronger codes aswell.
